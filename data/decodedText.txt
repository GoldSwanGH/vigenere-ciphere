SHE COULD IF YOU DO ILL SET DINAH AT YOUTHERE WAS A DEAD SILENCE INSTANTLY AND ALICE THOUGHT TO HERSELF I WONDER WHAT THEY WILL DO NEXT IF THEY HAD ANY SENSE THEYD TAKE THE ROOF OFF AFTER A MINUTE OR TWO THEY BEGAN MOVING ABOUT AGAIN AND ALICE HEARD THE RABBIT SAY A BARROWFUL WILL DO TO BEGIN WITHA BARROWFUL OF WHAT THOUGHT ALICE BUT SHE HAD NOT LONG TO DOUBT FOR THE NEXT MOMENT A SHOWER OF LITTLE PEBBLES CAME RATTLING IN AT THE WINDOW AND SOME OF THEM HIT HER IN THE FACE ILL PUT A STOP TO THIS SHE SAID TO HERSELF AND SHOUTED OUT YOUD BETTER NOT DO THAT AGAIN WHICH PRODUCED ANOTHER DEAD SILENCEALICE NOTICED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT THE PEBBLES WERE ALL TURNING INTO LITTLE CAKES AS THEY LAY ON THE FLOOR AND A BRIGHT IDEA CAME INTO HER HEAD IF I EAT ONE OF THESE CAKES SHE THOUGHT ITS SURE TO MAKE SOME CHANGE IN MY SIZE AND AS IT CANT POSSIBLY MAKE ME LARGER IT MUST MAKE ME SMALLER I SUPPOSESO SHE SWALLOWED ONE OF THE CAKES AND WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND THAT SHE BEGAN SHRINKING DIRECTLY AS SOON AS SHE WAS SMALL ENOUGH TO GET THROUGH THE DOOR SHE RAN OUT OF THE HOUSE AND FOUND QUITE A CROWD OF LITTLE ANIMALS AND BIRDS WAITING OUTSIDE THE POOR LITTLE LIZARD BILL WAS IN THE MIDDLE BEING HELD UP BY TWO GUINEAPIGS WHO WERE GIVING IT SOMETHING OUT OF A BOTTLE THEY ALL MADE A RUSH AT ALICE THE MOMENT SHE APPEARED BUT SHE RAN OFF AS HARD AS SHE COULD AND SOON FOUND HERSELF SAFE IN A THICK WOODTHE FIRST THING IVE GOT TO DO SAID ALICE TO HERSELF AS SHE WANDERED ABOUT IN THE WOOD IS TO GROW TO MY RIGHT SIZE AGAIN AND THE SECOND THING IS TO FIND MY WAY INTO THAT LOVELY GARDEN I THINK THAT WILL BE THE BEST PLANIT SOUNDED AN EXCELLENT PLAN NO DOUBT AND VERY NEATLY AND SIMPLY ARRANGED THE ONLY DIFFICULTY WAS THAT SHE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST IDEA HOW TO SET ABOUT IT AND WHILE SHE WAS PEERING ABOUT ANXIOUSLY AMONG THE TREES A LITTLE SHARP BARK JUST OVER HER HEAD MADE HER LOOK UP IN A GREAT HURRYAN ENORMOUS PUPPY WAS LOOKING DOWN AT HER WITH LARGE ROUND EYES AND FEEBLY STRETCHING OUT ONE PAW TRYING TO TOUCH HER POOR LITTLE THING SAID ALICE IN A COAXING TONE AND SHE TRIED HARD TO WHISTLE TO IT BUT SHE WAS TERRIBLY FRIGHTENED ALL THE TIME AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT BE HUNGRY IN WHICH CASE IT WOULD BE VERY LIKELY TO EAT HER UP IN SPITE OF ALL HER COAXINGHARDLY KNOWING WHAT SHE DID SHE PICKED UP A LITTLE BIT OF STICK AND HELD IT OUT TO THE PUPPY WHEREUPON THE PUPPY JUMPED INTO THE AIR OFF ALL ITS FEET AT ONCE WITH A YELP OF DELIGHT AND RUSHED AT THE STICK AND MADE BELIEVE TO WORRY IT THEN ALICE DODGED BEHIND A GREAT THISTLE TO KEEP HERSELF FROM BEING RUN OVER AND THE MOMENT SHE APPEARED ON THE OTHER SIDE THE PUPPY MADE ANOTHER RUSH AT THE STICK AND TUMBLED HEAD OVER HEELS IN ITS HURRY TO GET HOLD OF IT THEN ALICE THINKING IT WAS VERY LIKE HAVING A GAME OF PLAY WITH A CARTHORSE AND EXPECTING EVERY MOMENT TO BE TRAMPLED UNDER ITS FEET RAN ROUND THE THISTLE AGAIN THEN THE PUPPY BEGAN A SERIES OF SHORT CHARGES AT THE STICK RUNNING A VERY LITTLE WAY FORWARDS EACH TIME AND A LONG WAY BACK AND BARKING HOARSELY ALL THE WHILE TILL AT LAST IT SAT DOWN A GOOD WAY OFF PANTING WITH ITS TONGUE HANGING OUT OF ITS MOUTH AND ITS GREAT EYES HALF SHUTTHIS SEEMED TO ALICE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING HER ESCAPE SO SHE SET OFF AT ONCE AND RAN TILL SHE WAS QUITE TIRED AND OUT OF BREATH AND TILL THE PUPPYS BARK SOUNDED QUITE FAINT IN THE DISTANCEAND YET WHAT A DEAR LITTLE PUPPY IT WAS SAID ALICE AS SHE LEANT AGAINST A BUTTERCUP TO REST HERSELF AND FANNED HERSELF WITH ONE OF THE LEAVES I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TEACHING IT TRICKS VERY MUCH IFIF ID ONLY BEEN THE RIGHT SIZE TO DO IT OH DEAR ID NEARLY FORGOTTEN THAT IVE GOT TO GROW UP AGAIN LET ME SEEHOW IS IT TO BE MANAGED I SUPPOSE I OUGHT TO EAT OR DRINK SOMETHING OR OTHER BUT THE GREAT QUESTION IS WHATTHE GREAT QUESTION CERTAINLY WAS WHAT ALICE LOOKED ALL ROUND HER AT THE FLOWERS AND THE BLADES OF GRASS BUT SHE DID NOT SEE ANYTHING THAT LOOKED LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO EAT OR DRINK UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THERE WAS A LARGE MUSHROOM GROWING NEAR HER ABOUT THE SAME HEIGHT AS HERSELF AND WHEN SHE HAD LOOKED UNDER IT AND ON BOTH SIDES OF IT AND BEHIND IT IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT SHE MIGHT AS WELL LOOK AND SEE WHAT WAS ON THE TOP OF ITSHE STRETCHED HERSELF UP ON TIPTOE AND PEEPED OVER THE EDGE OF THE MUSHROOM AND HER EYES IMMEDIATELY MET THOSE OF A LARGE CATERPILLAR THAT WAS SITTING ON THE TOP WITH ITS ARMS FOLDED QUIETLY SMOKING A LONG HOOKAH AND TAKING NOT THE SMALLEST NOTICE OF HER OR OF ANYTHING ELSE
